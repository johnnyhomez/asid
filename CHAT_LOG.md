I want you to build me a website for my auntie.  This website is for a new business startup. the business is an early learning facility that gives children a head start on key intellectual  fundamentals that far exceed standard national curriculum. Also to develop fundamental physical motor skills and high level problem solving.  Targeted at the age group of 2.5 to 6 years old. The business will be based near the wollongong area and search engine optimization should target all affluent surrounding areas. The website needs a bright, colorful, interactive, dynamic, cheerful composition that dazzles the eye.  I think a catchy name for the business would be  Aunty  Saunta's Intellectual Development or ASID.

Please use placeholders for business details such as all contact details, address, ect as those details are yet to be finalised.

Some background on my auntie: she is a loving and intelligent  mother of 7 wonderful children who are now very successful, well adjusted adults. My auntie is in her early 50s and still has a lot of love and a wealth off teaching and child development  experience she wants to utilise. She has professional credentials [ for which I will provide more details in the future] and practical tertiary experience. She is very ambitious and entrepreneurial.

this website needs to prioritise search engine optimization as number one priority. Use the most powerful framework.  utiliz server side rendering if ideal.

Framework: Next.js (React with SSR/SSG - excellent for SEO)
Styling: Tailwind CSS (quick, responsive, can create vibrant designs)
SEO Tools: next-seo, sitemap generation, schema markup for local business
CMS Option: Headless CMS like Contentful or Strapi (for easy content management)
